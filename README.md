# ADBForwarder

Console application designed to handle forwarding TCP Ports (using [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)) between your PC and Quest HMDs. 

Specifically made for use with [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR), for now. Supports Quest 1 and 2

* You should see your device's serial ID show up in the console, if it says "Forwarded!" all is good.
